# GB Studio Fonts

This repository contains fonts I have created for use with [GB Studio](github.com/chrismaltby/gb-studio/).

These fonts are available under the [SIL Open Font License 1.1](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/ofl-1.1/), so you can use them in your own projects.

Right now the fonts available are:

- **DotGothic8**, an adaptation of [DotGothic16](https://github.com/fontworks-fonts/DotGothic16) by [Kokiabe](https://github.com/kokiabe)/[Fontworks Inc.](https://github.com/fontworks-fonts)
